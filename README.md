# electionsInformationSystem
Application for storing and retrieving information on Irish political elections.

The objective of this CA was to create an application for storing and retrieving information on Irish
political elections.

We were not to use any existing Java collections or data structures classes e.g.
ArrayList, LinkedList, or any other class that implements the Collection interface or any of its
children.

The app had to take in multiple user inputs about a politician/election or candidate.
Each politician/election or candidate would then have further information inputed such as DOB, political party, record of total votes etc.

User has ability to edit/update/delete politician, election and candidate information. 
Ability to search or filter elections by type and/or year.
Ability to search or filter politicians by (partial) name, party and/or location.
Listings of search results (for elections and politicians) were sorted depending
on the chosen search parameters/options. Sorting could be by: politician name, party, year (ascending or descending).

We had to use hashing as part of the project to avoid (excessive) linear/sequential searching.
